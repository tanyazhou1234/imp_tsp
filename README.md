## Description
A python class for measuring an impulse response with time-stretched pulse (TSP a.k.a. swept-sine) signal.
[pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) are required.

In `example.py`, the output file is written in MATLAB/Octave format using [scipy.io](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/io.html). `imp_fsXXXX_chXX.mat`

## Usage
The main class file is `imptsp.py`. The sampling frequency (Hz) and length of TSP signal (samples) must be specified. Please also refer to `example.py` for the usage.

First, the class file is imported in your python script:
```
from imptsp import imptsp
```

Initialize for the sampling frequency of 48kHz, TSP length of 65536 samples, and 2 channels:
```
imp = imptsp(48000, 65536, 2)
```

Measure the impulse response for input channel \#1 and \#2 and output channel \#1:
```
(ir,tsp) = imp.get_imp([1,2],1)
```
The impulse response data is stored in `ir` and the recorded TSP signal is stored in `tsp` for debugging.

Terminate:
```
imp.terminate()
```

If you want to check audio device information, run
```
python check_audio_dev.py
```

The other configuration for initialization is as follows:
* imptsp(Fs, tsp_len, [nchannel], [dev_id], [dbg_ch], [flg_fig], [flg_dump], [nsync], [flg_ud], [flg_eval])
  * Fs: sampling frequency
  * tsp_len: TSP length
  * nchannel: number of channels
  * dev_id: index of audio device
  * dbg_ch: channel number for debug
  * flg_fig:plot figure flag
  * flg_dump: output wavefile flag
  * nsync: number of synchronous additions
  * flg_ud: TSP up or down (0 or 1)
  * flg_eval: TSP evaluation flag
